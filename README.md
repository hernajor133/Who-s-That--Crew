## Description
A Node.js application that takes in information about employees on a team, to then generate an HTML webpage that displays information for each crew member for an ease of access experience.

## Criteria
GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
WHEN I am prompted for my team members and their information
THEN an HTML file is generated that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on user input
WHEN I click on an email address in the HTML
THEN my default email program opens and populates the TO field of the email with the address
WHEN I click on the GitHub username
THEN that GitHub profile opens in a new tab
WHEN I start the application
THEN I am prompted to enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number
WHEN I enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number
THEN I am presented with a menu with the option to add an engineer or an intern or to finish building my team
WHEN I select the engineer option
THEN I am prompted to enter the engineer’s name, ID, email, and GitHub username, and I am taken back to the menu
WHEN I select the intern option
THEN I am prompted to enter the intern’s name, ID, email, and school, and I am taken back to the menu
WHEN I decide to finish building my team
THEN I exit the application, and the HTML is generated

## User-Story
AS A manager
I WANT to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info
SO THAT I have quick access to their emails and GitHub profiles
## Installation 
Install 'inquirer' and 'jest'
## Usage 
Any Employee can use this application to generate information of each crew member of their respective team. With clickable links to checkout their github or to send an email, this application will speed up work productivity.
## Tests 
Several tests were created to test each referanced javaScript file to it`s respective classes. This had to be done in order to ensure that each answered question was being passed down correctly in order to generate an HTML file.
